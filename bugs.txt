Known bugs and limitations
**************************

mKEYB relies on the BIOS to do most of the work. It should work on any machine where 
the BIOS: 
 - uses INT 15,4F to allow for keyboard translation,
 - implements the INT 16,5 service (Keyboard buffer write),
 - populates the Keyboard Flags Bytes at 40:17 and 40:96.
 
All the required functionalities are present in the IBM XT BIOS after 11/8/82, and in 
most (all?) AT and PS/2 class machines. The situation differs for XT clones, where
different models implement different subsets of the three functionalities.

If the BIOS do not support INT 15,4F, the /9 switch installs a new INT9 handler that 
calls INT 15,4F to do keyboard translation. The handler should work on any machine 
with a keyboard controller that is compatible with the 8255 PPI: data buffer at port 
60h and status register at port 61h. 

With the /G switch, mKEYB installs also a handler for the INT 16,5, if your BIOS do 
not have it. 

All layouts are designed for an Enhanced 101/102 keys keyboard. 

Confirmed working machines:
 - Amstrad PC5086: real and emulated, chain INT9 needed
 - Amstrad PC2086, PC3086: emulated, chain INT9 needed
 - Toshiba T1200: emulated, no need to chain INT9 since BIOS uses INT 15,4F 
 - Tandy 1000 SL/2: emulated, no need to chain INT9 since BIOS uses INT 15,4F
 - IBM XT: emulated, no need to chain INT9 since BIOS uses INT 15,4F
