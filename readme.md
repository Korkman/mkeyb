# What is mKEYB

mKEYB is a minimum keyboard driver for xxDOS, requiring less than 1Kb of memory to support international keyboards, developed by Tom Ehlert at

[http://www.drivesnapshot.de/freedos/mkeyb.htm](http://www.drivesnapshot.de/freedos/mkeyb.htm)

The original version of mKEYB requires a 80286 or better machine. This repository hosts a modified version of mKEYB that can run on XT machines.

It does not run on all XT clones, however. To have all functionalities, you need an enhanced 101/102 keys keyboard, and a BIOS with enough functionalities to support international layouts. See the document [bugs.txt](bugs.txt) for more 
information on compatibility, bugs and limitations of the driver.
